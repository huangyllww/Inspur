/**
  Convert status code value to the times of beep.

  @param  CodeType         Indicates the type of status code being reported.
  @param  Value            Describes the current status of a hardware or
                           software entity. This includes information about the class and
                           subclass that is used to classify the entity as well as an operation.
                           For progress codes, the operation is the current activity.
                           For error codes, it is the exception.For debug codes,it is not defined at this time.
  @param  Instance         The enumeration of a hardware or software entity within
                           the system. A system may contain multiple entities that match a class/subclass
                           pairing. The instance differentiates between them. An instance of 0 indicates
                           that instance information is unavailable, not meaningful, or not relevant.
                           Valid instance numbers start with 1.
  @param  CallerId         This optional parameter may be used to identify the caller.
                           This parameter allows the status code driver to apply different rules to
                           different callers.
  @param  Data             This optional parameter may be used to pass additional data.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS      Status code reported to beep successfully.
